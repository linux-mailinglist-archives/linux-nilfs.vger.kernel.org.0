Logically, in the case of standard LFS, I think it's correct that GC
reduces issues caused by atime update writes to workload issues rather
than disk usage issues.

However, NILFS also has the property of being a filesystem that stores
past data and metadata. For example, by default, updates (checkpoints)
within the last hour are protected.

Therefore, even with GC, there is a possibility of disk usage attacks
by performing path lookups and file accesses repeatedly within an
hour.
So, please be aware of this difference in assumptions.

When I said "atime support level," I wasn't referring to drastic
changes in implementation, but rather to differences in update
frequency from this perspective.

Having said that, on standard systems, relatime is the default, and I
agree that this should not be a problem by default, as it
significantly reduces atime updates for on-memory inodes.

If we allow strictatime (without specifying reduction options such as
relatime or noatime), it may be a good idea to issue a warning at
mount time.
This can be done on the tool side (mount.nilfs2 helper side) and does
not necessarily need to be implemented in the kernel.

As for lazytime, it may be better to do the same, considering that
atime updates triggered by inode evictions result in dirty blocks.

Yes, I agree that atime support is needed anyway.

In that case, I think the safest option, relatime, is chosen.

Yes, that's right.
Using these fields for atime minimizes compatibility issues.
However, strictly speaking, you need to be careful of the following points:

- Both mkfs.nilfs2 and the nilfs2 metadata file initialize these
fields to 0, so we may need to consider replacing 0 with the same
value as ctime/mtime or current_time() when detected.

- In the current implementation, these fields are not cleared on
deletion, so if an inode is deleted and reused on an older version,
and then mounted on a newer version that supports atime, the atime
value may inherit the value from the previous inode.

The inode size in nilfs2 is defined in the superblock, and although it
is possible to extend it, this requires more rigor than compatibility
control, and would be better done together with xattr support.

I used getfattr to aggregate xattr sizes on a certain server with
ext4-based partitions, and created a histogram, and the distribution
was as follows:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---
 SIZE RANGE : COUNT  | DISTRIBUTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------=
---
  32 -   47 : 563265 | ##################################################
  48 -   63 : 249520 | ######################

  80 -   95 :  11158 |

On NAS servers, the percentage of files over 100 bytes was slightly
higher, at about 6%.

The tendency for duplicate xattr values varies depending on the system.
With only SELinux security labels, there are many duplicate values.
On the other hand, there are also cases where different values, such
as checksums and ID tags, are written for each file (e.g., on a NAS).

One possible implementation of xattr is to use free inodes (for
example, allocating contiguous inodes).
However, considering that inodes will eventually need to be expanded,
I recommend a hybrid configuration, assuming expansion to 256 bytes or
more, uses the latter portion for inline xattr, and pushes anything
that doesn't fit into that area to a reserved xattr metadata file
(NILFS_XATTR_INO inode).

Let's leave the discussion of xattr implementation as a separate issue.

When considering atime, I think the key is whether we determine that
the current 128-byte inode will be used up by atime.
My opinion is the same as yours: Yes.
