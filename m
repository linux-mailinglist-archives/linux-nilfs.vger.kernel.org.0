Yes, that's generally my understanding.

Just one thing: as long as issuing warnings for strictatime and
lazytime, I think handling them in the mount.nilfs2 helper is fine.
But if we find that the filesystem gets stuck due to atime updates
(e.g., unable to recover from a disk-full state), then the kernel
should enforce the rejection to prevent the unsafe state.

Yes, I agree.
