Hi Veter,

I've been fixing bugs reported by Google's automatic fuzzing tool
called "syzbot" (particularly intensively over the last several
years), so I believe the current version is pretty stable.

However, since this activity is still ongoing, it is not possible to
say that there are no bugs.  Fortunately or unfortunately, a few major
bugs have been recently been fixed.

> 2. Are the errors I sent corrected? If fixed, then starting with what ver=
sion of the kernel?

I can't say for sure due to lack of information, but the logs you
reported appear to be symptoms of a high impact mmap regression that
was fixed within the last three months.

Assuming the problem occurred in v6.6.12 of subject, the following
important fixes have not yet been backported to this version,
including the mmap regression fix.   Regarding stable-6.6.y, versions
below v6.6.24 (latest) do not include all important fixes.

$ git shortlog v6.6.12..v6.6.24 fs/nilfs2

Ryusuke Konishi (5):
      nilfs2: fix data corruption in dsync block recovery for small block s=
izes
      nilfs2: fix hang in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()
      nilfs2: fix potential bug in end_buffer_async_write
      nilfs2: fix failure to detect DAT corruption in btree and direct mapp=
ings
      nilfs2: prevent kernel bug at submit_bh_wbc()

On the other hand, v6.7.12 (latest) and v6.8.4 (not latest) included
all of these important fixes.

As for the logs, all messages in the logs are warning and are harmless
in themselves.  However, they are often produced due to the influence
of other problems, so you need to be careful in that sense.

> Apr 14 15:10:10 MainPC kernel: NILFS (dm-5): discard dirty page: offset=
=3D2579136512, ino=3D3

This message indicates that there were changes that could not be
written to disk and were discarded during unmounting, and is likely to
occur when the file system is degraded to read-only.

> Apr 14 15:10:24 MainPC kernel: NILFS (dm-5): nilfs_get_block (ino=3D55694=
): a race condition while inserting a data block at offset=3D0

This message indicates that an unexpected race occurred when writing,
but the bug that outputs this message has been recently fixed, so it
may be that.  Of the patches listed above that have not been applied
to v6.6.12, these are the the following two:

      nilfs2: fix potential bug in end_buffer_async_write
      nilfs2: fix failure to detect DAT corruption in btree and direct mapp=
ings


If the environment in which these messages were output is v6.7.12 or
v6.8.4 and you think this is not the cause, it would be helpful if you
could report the situation in more detail.

Ryusuke Konishi
