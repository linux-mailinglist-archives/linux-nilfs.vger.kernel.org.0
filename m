Yes, it's OK to set up a git repository first.
In that case, we will only need to make the changes to the MAINTAINERS
file once, so I'll send one patch for the next merge window.

Not only do we add an M: field and switch the T: field, but the S:
field in the MAINTAINERS file should also be updated to reflect the
current status, so I'll make these changes all at once.

Please let me know where the repository is once you've set it up.

Thanks for the detailed explanation of the steps ;)
It's almost exactly what I used to do a long time ago.

Yes, in that case, I don't think there's any need to change the
method, so please operate the nilfs2 upstreaming tree in the same way
- as before, let's exchange patches without creating a main branch for
the project.

Thanks,
Ryusuke Konishi
