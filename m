The Miraculous Fatima Rosary
 HYPERLINK "https://dightongroup.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/rosary-brochure-en_pagenumber.001-1.png"
A specially hand made Rosary made the old fashion way by senior citizens in the area of Fatima, Portugal, which aids them with their low retirement income which in times is not even sufficient for their medication needs. Saddly to say but lets help them as much as possible.
This Rosary is had-made in Fatima with beads collected from the Holy Trees located in the path of the Apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima. The beads have also been found to have certain healing powers and were used in ancient time for their healing effects.
