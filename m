Hi Ryusuke,

Thank you for your prompt reply!

I investigated this issue further based on your feedback.  Yes, we
manually started nilfs_cleanerd in addition to the one triggered by
the mount.nilfs2, so two nilfs_cleanerd processes are running as
indicated in the "ps" output.

I used the latest version of nilfs-utils-2.2.11 and conducted some new
experiments.  However, when I relied solely on the "nilfs_cleanerd"
started by "mount.nilfs2", the NILFS2 file system remained at a high
usage percentage (88%) even after all files and directories were
deleted.  I also tried mounting with the "nogc" option and manually
starting the cleaner using "nilfs_cleanerd -p 1 ${DEVICE}
${MOUNT_POINT}", which consistently reduced space usage to 50%.  I
believe this is because the manually-started nilfs_cleanerd sets the
interval (-p) to 1.  I would like to know if the space usage result
after cleaning is reasonable, considering it was initially 25% when
the file system was first mounted.  Additionally, it seems like
running two instances of nilfs_cleanerd for a single device can
potentially cause issues that prevent the cleaner from freeing up
space.

I have updated the script accordingly.  Please feel free to contact me
if you need anything from my side.  Thanks again.

Best regards,

Yifei Liu
