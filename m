Bugzilla is a system that easily integrates with mailing list
workflows, which is probably why it has been in use at kernel.org for
so long. However, to be honest, I don't think it's suitable for a
project starting BTS now.

The requirements I envision are similar to those of syzbot. It's not
difficult. Specifically,

- Interactions with the mailing list should be linked to issues,
allowing for bidirectional referencing.
- Optionally, the ability to indirectly control issue tracking by
sending a specific CC: email to a specific BTS-linked email address
using a specific format (such as syzbot's #syz dup: or #syz fix:
control method).
- More optionally, the ability to use OSS activity support features
(such as syzbot's #syz test: command, which allows us to delegate
reproduction testing).
In today's world, it would be something like the ability to kick off
an AI engine and request a first-stage analysis of the issue using
concise natural language.

I think it would probably be a good idea to register issues on GitHub
anyway, use a self-hosted n8n as the glue for example, and link GitHub
and gmail (for ML integration) with an AI engine like Gemini and
ChatGPT.
However, posting AI output to a public mailing list raises social
responsibility issues, which is an obstacle to a public email-based
workflow.
(We'll probably need a moderation mechanism in place to ensure only
developer-approved content is sent to ML.)
