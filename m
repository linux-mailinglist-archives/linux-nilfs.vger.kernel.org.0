The log messages indicate that the situation is quite severe.

>      [  486.099403] NILFS (sdc1): invalid segment: Magic number mismatch

This message indicates that the magic number in the header of the log
pointed to by a superblock is abnormal, that is, the log data is
corrupted on disk.

And this message indicates that although recovery was attempted using
a spare superblock, the previous log pointed to by that pointer was
also corrupted.

Therefore, the data immediately before the problem probably has not
been written to the disk, and cannot be salvaged.

NILFS2 is designed to write log data  to media and then update the
superblock pointer, and to be safe, the superblock is duplicated so
that you can retroactively mount logs from a while ago.   It's rare
that either of these remedies doesn't work, and this usually doesn't
happen even with a sudden power cut.

Normally, even with a disk cache, this will not happen if the minimum
guaranteed write ordering and flushing semantics are properly
guaranteed.  There may be probably a bug in the device driver or the
disk firmware, or the disk may not be reliable to begin with.
Or perhaps the data that was supposed to have been written to the
media was unfortunately corrupted retroactively.

If there is no backup, the only way to rescue old data is to manually
rewrite the number of the last segment number (and associated
checkpoint and sequence numbers) in superblocks and successfully mount
it with read-only and norecovery mount options.  Unfortunately, there
is no easy way to recover from this level of destruction.

Since it cannot be mounted, the lssu command cannot be used to
determine the state of segments.  Instead, try checking the status
with the nilfs-tune and dumpseg commands:

$ sudo nilfs-tune -l /dev/sdc1

will list information written in a superblock.  And,

$ i=3D0; while [ $i -lt 511 ]; do sudo dumpseg /dev/sdc1 $i | head -4;
let i=3Di+1; done

writes out information (such as sequence number and creation date and
time) for segments with valid logs.
Here, 511 is the number of segments, so use the value in the "Number
of segments:" field in the nilfs-tune output for your device.

This will give you an overview of the logs (segments) written to disk.

Try dumping the information of the segment that appears to be the
newest using  dumpseg without the head command, and look for the
segment containing "ino =3D 3" (the inode number of that DAT metadata
file written at the end of the checkpointed log).
For instance, if the 100th segment appears to be the newest, try the follow=
ing:

$ sudo dumpseg /dev/sdc1 100

Since manually rewriting the segment pointer in a superblock is a
dangerous operation, I will omit it here.
I think it is important to first understand the current situation.
